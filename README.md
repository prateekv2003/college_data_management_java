#College Management System is a program to collect, store and display every student and staff details of the college.

We create a login frame where each **staff/admin** has to enter their username and password to access the portal. Once the portal opens, you will have a navbar which will be briefly explained ahead. 
The first menu will be for adding new teacher and student details (containing address, name, age, dob, etc.). 
The second menu option will display all these details of respective students and teachers alongwith a Unique ID generated by the program.
There is also an option to mark attendance and view the same. 
Examination details of students can also be added and displayed as well by the staff. 
Fee payment details of those students who have paid the fees is stored and displayed as well, which can be paid through the portal itself. 
Also, there will be extra features such as web browser, calculator, notepad, and contact us page.
